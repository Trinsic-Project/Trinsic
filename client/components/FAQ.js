            Certain terms and phrases tend to come up when researching smart contracts and the blockchain system. At times, these concepts can become challenging to keep track of and piece together. Below is a collection of questions, answers, and additional resources that may help demystify this new and innovative technology.

                The blockchain, a value-exchange protocol, is an incorruptible
                digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed
                to record not just financial transactions but virtually
                everything of value.
              </li>
              <li>
                A blockchain is a continuously growing list of chronological and
                publically available records, called blocks, which are linked
                and secured using cryptography.
              </li>
              <li>
                The blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that underlies
                cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and platforms like Ethereum. It
                provides a way to record and transfer data that is transparent,
                safe, auditable, and resistant to outages. The blockchain has
                the ability to make the organizations that use it transparent,
                democratic, decentralized, efficient, and secure.
              </li>
              <br />
              In other words: The blockchain is a shared pool of information
              that has immutable (cannot be tampered with) blocks of information
              and is distributed with everyone involved as it constantly
              updates. There is no one single person or organization in charge
              of the blockchain, which means the data is more protected from
              hacking, exploitation, or becoming lost. People can then have
              significantly more autonomy and ownership of their data.

              What is a smart contract?
            </Typography>

          <ExpansionPanelDetails>
            <Typography>
              <li>
                A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally
                facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of
                a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible
                transactions without third parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                A smart contract is a computer code built onto the blockchain
                that executes automatically, allowing the exchange of anything
                of value (money, property, content, etc) when certain
                conditions, namely those of the contract, are met.
              </li>
              <li>
                While a standard contract outlines the terms of a relationship
                (usually one enforceable by law), a smart contract enforces a
                relationship with cryptographic code. Put differently, smart
                contracts are programs that execute exactly as they are set up
                to by their creators.
              </li>
              <br />
              In other words: A digital smart contract, much like a conventional
              paper contract, is a program between parties that executes upon
              the fulfillment of terms. It is objective in the sense that there
              is a strict cause-and-effect system it follows. For example, if
              one person pays money for another person's car and it is confirmed
              that the car has transferred ownership, then the smart contract
              would release the funds to the seller of the car. If A happens,
              then B is the outcome.

              Why are there fees to initializing and finalizing a smart
              contract?
            </Typography>
          </ExpansionPanelSummary>

            <Typography>
              <li>
                To actually execute smart contract code on the Ethereum
                platform, someone has to send enough Ether as a transaction fee.
                The amount of Ether needed depends on the computing resources
                required. This payment is necessary for the Ethereum nodes and
                miners participating and providing their computing power,
                energy, bandwidth, and electricity.
              </li>
              <li>
                The minimum fee necessary for a transaction to be processed and
                confirmed is based on the intersection of supply and demand in
                the blockchain's free market for block space.
              </li>
              <li>
                The block reward is essentially a revenue item for miners for
                solving a complex algorithmic problem, and a cost item for
                consumers who store content on the blockchain. Typically, miners
                choose which transactions they want to include in each block,
                based on how high their transaction fees are. The higher the
                transaction fee, the higher priority your transaction will have,
                meaning the faster it will be included as a block on the
                blockchain.
              </li>
              <br />
              In other words: Resources such as time and energy are used to
              support the continuation of the blockchain, something miners tend
              to believe in and also benefit from as more users participate in
              the community. Miners contribute to securing and building out the
              blockchain, and they are partly incentivized by transaction fees.
              As long as transaction fees are not too expensive for users while
              also being economic enough for miners to continue securing the
              network, the blockchain will be favorable for everyone involved in
              the community.

              What is the "complex algorithmic problem" miners are tasked to
              solve?

          <ExpansionPanelDetails>
            <Typography>
              <li>
                You may have heard that miners are solving difficult
                mathematical problems, but that's not true at all. What they're
                actually doing is trying to be the first miner to come up with a
                64-digit hexadecimal number (a "hash") that is less than or
                equal to the target hash. It is guesswork.
              </li>
              <li>
                Miners search for an acceptable hash by choosing a number,
                converting the number, and checking. If the hash doesn’t have
                the right number of leading zeroes, they change the number,
                convert the number, and check again.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because it is practically impossible to predict the outcome of
                input, hash functions can be used for proof of work and
                validation. Bitcoin miners will compete to find an input that
                gives a specific value (a number with multiple zeros at the
                start). The difficulty of these puzzles is measurable. However,
                they cannot be cheated on. This is because there is no way to
                perform better than by guessing blindly.
              </li>
              <br />
              In other words: The complex algorithmic problem is usually
              described as a mathematics problem, but it is more closely related
              to a unique puzzle. Miners essentially make a tremendous amount of
              guesses (the work) at picking a combination of sixty-four letters
              and numbers and if it happens to meet a certain criteria, then a
              proof of work is published that allows for the soon-to-be verified
              block to be added to the blockchain.
